# UFOs

## Overview
In this project we will create a webpage and dynamic table that display data of UFO sightings around the world.
The webpage will have the dynamic table allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, which will include date, city, country, and shape filters.

## Results
This is how our UFO webpage will look like:

The user can find the table of UFO sightings data  at the bottom of the page.
If the user to search for a specific data, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO sighting, the user should go to the filters section at the bottom left and fill the information of what they want to find.
For example, if I want to search for UFO sightings in the state of Texas, I would type the state code “tx” on the state box, 

![filtertx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78781719/125150988-907d0600-e109-11eb-8a35-640b5117db96.PNG)

If the user wants to find a specific data and state, they can do it by typing the information on the corresponding filter boxes.
For example, if I want to know the shape of UFO that was seen on Fayetteville on January 12 2010,
I can type the city and date on both boxes, and this is the result:


![fayetteville](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78781719/125151134-8dcee080-e10a-11eb-883b-e99521678116.PNG)





## Summary

For further improvement we could add to the table links to webpages for more information of the sightings and more information that can be filtered, like the city, state or country with the most UFO’s sightings, what shape has being sighted the most and where. 
Could the place be attracting a specific shape?  
With filters on the quantities we could make a more in depth analysis.
